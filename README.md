## Description
A quickly build VS Code extension to add a statusbar message to monitor your GitHub Codespaces includes hours.

The only thing I know now is that it works on my computer ☺️ \
I encourage you to test it, but use at your own risk!

Fetches your remaining core hours at the start of VS Code when the extension is enables,\
or when you enable the extension.
Fetches your remaining hours when clicking the statusbar message.

## Known Issues
Will only work on VS Code 1.100+, because of the reliance on Octokit ESM.\
If there is demand, I will make it work for versions prior 1.100

There are no functional tests yet. I will write them for the next version.

Works only in VS Code Desktop. When there is demand, I will build it for VS Code Web

There is no icon yet. I would love to receive an icon made by you!
